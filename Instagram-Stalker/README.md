# Instagram-Stalker

## Clone

    git clone https://github.com/OldKokoroz/Instagram-Stalker.git


    pip install -r requirements.txt

or install manually:

    pip install instabot pwinput


## Usage:

I don't recommend using your main account even though nothing is going to happen


Create a bot account and enter it when the program asks you to.


After that, enter the username of the victim you want to stalk.


## -----

It Ä±s a new project so it just gets all of the followers of the victim.

Program works even if the account is private.
